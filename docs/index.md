# Unitary Game Engine

Unitary is a Python library that helps game developers add quantum behavior to their games.

The Unitary library's API intends to provide common operations that enable a programmer to add behavior to their game mechanic, or game objects, based on the core principles of Quantum Information Science (QIS):

*   Superposition
*   Entanglement
*   Interference
*   Measurement

While the library can be used for other purposes, the Unitary library is designed for game developers. The library is an extension of Google's Cirq library, which enables people to specify circuits for quantum computing.

## Quantum Chess

The pilot project of unitary is quantum chess, a variant of chess that uses
additional rules related to quantum concepts, using unitary transformations.
