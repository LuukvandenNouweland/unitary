    ">Add quantum behavior to games without a PhD in physics.</div>

The Unitary library enables software developers to add quantum behavior to their
systems without mastering in the underlying math. We thought games would be a
great place to start.

You can get familiar with the library in the unitary/alpha/README.md file, then
start playing around with the games in the unitary/examples directory.

This project grew out of the open-source version of Christopher Cantwell's
quantum chess engine. We maintain the open source
`quantum chess project <quantum_chess/index`_, but you can also play
`the commercial version of the game <https://quantumchess.net>`_, or read
`the paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05836>`_ that started everything.
